# LARubyConf Vagrant Examples

These are the examples from the talk I gave at LARubyConf.
These examples are meant to be run with **Vagrant 0.7.x**.

## Running the Examples

All the examples are setup such that you can go into any
of the directories (such as `refinery_cms`), run `vagrant up`,
wait some period of time, and then open up the proper URL and
see results!

For more information, see the README available in each
subdirectory.
